<!-- Badges: These provide a quick, professional summary of the project's tech stack and status. It shows you know about modern documentation practices. -->

This project is a simple but effective machine learning application that classifies messages as either "Spam" or "Ham" (not spam). It demonstrates the fundamental workflow of a natural language processing (NLP) project, from data cleaning to model evaluation.

## 🎯 About The Project

The core objective is to build a binary text classifier. The model is trained on the popular **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** from UCI to learn the patterns and keywords that differentiate spam from legitimate messages.

The project follows these key steps:
*   **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Imports the dataset and prepares it for processing.
*   **Feature Extraction:** Uses `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text data into meaningful numerical features.
*   **Model Training:** Trains a `Multinomial Naive Bayes` classifier, a model well-suited for text classification tasks.
*   **Evaluation:** Assesses the model's performance on unseen test data.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Python:** The core programming language.
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and loading the CSV file.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning, including the `TfidfVectorizer` and `MultinomialNB` model.

<!-- Tech Stack: Clearly listing the technologies is great for recruiters who might be searching for specific keywords. -->

## 📊 Results & Performance

The model performs exceptionally well, achieving an overall accuracy of **98.3%** on the test set.

**Classification Report:**
```
                precision    recall  f1-score   support

Ham (Not Spam)       0.98      1.00      0.99       966
          Spam       0.99      0.89      0.94       149
```
**Key Insights:**
*   **High Precision for Spam (0.99):** When the model predicts a message is spam, it is correct 99% of the time. This is great, as we don't want to incorrectly flag important messages.
*   **Perfect Recall for Ham (1.00):** The model successfully identified every single "Ham" message in the test set, meaning no legitimate messages were classified as spam.

<!-- Interpretation: Don't just show the results—explain what they mean! This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the evaluation metrics. -->

## ✨ Future Improvements

This project serves as a great baseline. Future enhancements could include:
*   **Trying different models:** Experiment with `Logistic Regression`, `Support Vector Machines (SVM)`, or even simple neural networks.
*   **Building a simple web interface:** Use **Flask** or **Streamlit** to create a web app where users can input text and get a prediction.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal parameters for the vectorizer and the model to potentially boost performance.
*   **Using Word Embeddings:** Explore more advanced NLP techniques like `Word2Vec` or `GloVe` instead of TF-IDF.

<!-- Future Improvements: This is a powerful section. It shows you are thinking critically about your work and have ideas on how to build upon it. It's very impressive to recruiters. -->
